# Honkai Star Rail Warp Calculator

This website calculates the probability distribution of the number of rolls it takes to acquire a given number of rate up 5 stars. It then displays these values in a graph.


## Rules
Honkai Star Rail has the following rules for rolling (first value is for characters, second is for Light Cones):
- base 0.6%/0.8% chance for 5 star
- starting at roll 74/66, the rate of a 5 star increases by 6%/7%
- a 5 star is guarenteed by roll 90/80
- given a 5 star is rolled there is a 56.25%/78.125% chance that the rate up 5 star is rolled
- if a 5 star is rolled and it is not the rate up 5 star, then the next 5 star is guarenteed to be the rate up
